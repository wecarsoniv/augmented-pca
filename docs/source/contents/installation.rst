Installation
============


Dependencies
------------

The APCA library is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.6 to run. APCA relies on the following libraries and version numbers:

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ >= 3.6
* `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ >= 1.19.2
* `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ >= 1.5.2

It is possible APCA models will still work with installed dependencies with version numbers less than the ones listed. However, for best performance dependencies with version numbers equal to or greater than those listed are recommended.
