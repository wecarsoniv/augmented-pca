Welcome to the Augmented PCA docmentation!

Augmented Principal Component Analysis (Augmented PCA or APCA) is a library written in Python that provides 
implementations of linear factor models that find a set of factors aligned with an *augmenting* objective in addition 
to the canonical PCA objective of finding factors that represent the data variance.
